            <h4>Stuck</h4>
            <p>Created to show understanding of the human form and using the white of the paper in a composition. This piece was inspired by the feeling of paralysis when overwhelmed or conflicted.</p>
            <p>Size: 18" x 24"
            <br>Medium: Colored Pencils</p>
          </div>

          <div class="txt rtf">
            <h4>The Eagle vs The Cobra</h4>
            <p>Created to accompany the story "The Nightengale and the Blind Worm." The idea stemmed from sci-fi elements that I felt especially inspired by at the time. I was also excited to include a snake in my design because I love the way they move, and they emphasize the feeling of unease in the scene.</p>
            <p>Size: 11" 15"
            <br>Medium: Ink</p>

            <h4>A Shameless Display</h4>
            <p>Created to show understanding of hands and a split-complementary color scheme. I wanted to do a play on a typical still-life setup of a bowl of fruit or flowers. The background and composition were inspired by Rembrandt still-life paintings.</p>

            <h4>The Three Little Guys</h4>
            <p>Illustration created for the story "The Three Brothers." This composition was meant to feel like a winding road, a long journey that the characters have gone on. The environment is a sort of post-apocolyptic wasteland that adds to the uncany feeling of the piece.</p>

                <h4>Sophisticated Magazine Spread: The Dahlia</h4>

                    <h4>Young Adult Magazine Spread: The Dahlia</h4>
                    <p>Created to show understanding of young adult design and typography. I was inspired by collage art and used overlapping shapes and uneven baselines to add chaos to the composition that complements the themes of the story.</p>

                    <p>Created as a hypothetical design for a vinyl cover. I created illustrations that complemented the acoustic feeling of the album and laid them out by hand to give the design a sense of chaos that went with the themes in the songs. </p>

            <h4>Growth in Fashion Infographic</h4>
            <p>Created to illustrate various data points through an infographic poster. I used a minimal color scheme for the majority of the composition to show the limits that used to exist in fashion. More colors are included in in the graphics that show the growth of modern fashion.</p>
